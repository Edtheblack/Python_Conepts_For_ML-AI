# This script demonstrates basic Python concepts used in machine learning and AI

# Section 1: Variables and Data Types
# Define some basic variables
x = 5  # Integer
y = 3.14  # Floating point
name = "Yuji"  # String
is_active = True  # Boolean

# Print variables
print("Defined Variables:")
print("Integer:", x)
print("Floating Point:", y)
print("String:", name)
print("Boolean:", is_active)

# Section 2: Basic Operations
# Perform and print arithmetic operations
sum = x + 10
product = y * 2
division = x / 2
print("\nBasic Operations:")
print("Sum of x and 10:", sum)
print("Product of y and 2:", product)
print("Division of x by 2:", division)

# Section 3: Control Structures
# Using if statement and loops
print("\nControl Structures:")
if x > 0:
    print(x, "is positive")

# For loop example
print("For Loop:")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop example
print("While Loop:")
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Section 4: Functions
# Define and call a function
def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name + "!"
message = greet("Yuji")
print("\nFunction Output:")
print(message)

# Section 5: Lists and Dictionaries
# Working with collections
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
person = {"name": "Yuji", "age": 25}
print("\nLists and Dictionaries:")
print("Second fruit in list:", fruits[1])
print("Name from dictionary:", person["name"])
